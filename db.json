what is java?
ans. Java is object oriented, platefor independent and robust programming language which is developed by Jems Goslin in at sun microsystem
in 19995. There are four people who developed this language and one of theme is MR Vinod Khosla who is an Indian, he was  cofounder of 
sunmicro system and after two year he left the company and after two year java is developed in that company. sun people wants to keep the 
name of the java language like oak but this name is already registered with another company and thats why they keep  the name of this 
language like java. Actually there is no logic to keep the name of this language java but they ware consuming coffee too much and thats why
they keep the name of this language like java, java is nothing but a coffee bread. at this time sunmicrosystem is acquared 
by Oracle Inc. in $7billion in 2012.
